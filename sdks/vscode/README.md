# Inherited OpenCode VS Code Extension

> **Status — retained OpenCode extension outside Repa's TUI baseline.** This README documents the inherited extension and its source-local development workflow. It does not make VS Code a Repa product, install, build, support, or release surface; an accepted Repa ADR or Gate must explicitly admit that scope.
> Current Repa authority is indexed by the [documentation map](../../docs/README.md).

This retained Visual Studio Code extension was designed to integrate [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) into a coding workflow.

## Upstream Prerequisite

The inherited extension expects the upstream [OpenCode CLI](https://opencode.ai). This is not a Repa installation requirement or compatibility commitment.

## Features

- **Quick Launch**: Use `Cmd+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Esc` (Windows/Linux) to open opencode in a split terminal view, or focus an existing terminal session if one is already running.
- **New Session**: Use `Cmd+Shift+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` (Windows/Linux) to start a new opencode terminal session, even if one is already open. You can also click the opencode button in the UI.
- **Context Awareness**: Automatically share your current selection or tab with opencode.
- **File Reference Shortcuts**: Use `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac) or `Alt+Ctrl+K` (Linux/Windows) to insert file references. For example, `@File#L37-42`.

## Historical Upstream Support

The original early-release instructions directed feedback to the upstream OpenCode issue tracker. That tracker is provenance for this retained extension, not Repa's support channel.

## Source-Local Development

1. `code sdks/vscode` - Open the `sdks/vscode` directory in VS Code. **Do not open from repo root.**
2. `bun install` - Run inside the `sdks/vscode` directory.
3. Press `F5` to start debugging - This launches a new VS Code window with the extension loaded.

#### Making Changes

`tsc` and `esbuild` watchers run automatically during debugging (visible in the Terminal tab). Changes to the extension are automatically rebuilt in the background.

To test your changes:

1. In the debug VS Code window, press `Cmd+Shift+P`
2. Search for `Developer: Reload Window`
3. Reload to see your changes without restarting the debug session
